## Description
> Website uses multiple JavaScript files to not only record user input but also check that against the correct answer and then display whether the user was right or wrong. The quiz has five questions, if you get a question wrong then 10 seconds are deducted from the time left on the timer which started at 75 seconds. Your score is dependent upon how many seconds you have left over.
